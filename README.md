# hl7

## Overview

This is a fork of [Conrad Pankoff's HL7 parser](https://github.com/deoxxa/hl7).

HL7v2 stands for "Health Level 7: Version 2" - a specification for shuttling
clinical data around and between medical institutions. While working on
[Medtasker](http://medtasker.com/) with [Nimblic](https://github.com/nimblic),
I've written this library for reading the protocol and querying the messages
it contains.

I have a [blog post](https://www.fknsrs.biz/blog/golang-hl7-library.html) on
my website if you'd like to hear a bit more of the story.
